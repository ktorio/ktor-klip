KLIP - Ktor Library Improvement Proposals ðŸ“Ž
=============================================

Starting from [Ktor](https://ktor.io) 3.0.0, all significant changes to the library will pass through this repository 
for an initial review of the design before implementation.

The goal of this process is to promote transparency and collaboration in the development of the library, as in the 
spirit of the [Request of Comments (RFC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) process developed by the 
[Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force).

## Current KLIPs

* New KLIPs and additions to current KLIPs are submitted as [pull requests](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-klip/pulls).
* When KLIPs are implemented, the corresponding design documents are merged into this repository and stored in a [proposals](proposals) directory.

## Contributing

We are always interested in new ideas for improving Ktor.  Not every idea needs to be reviewed here, nor do we expect 
submissions for the changes that do warrant consideration.

Generally, all that's required is [reaching out to us on Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T09229ZC6/C0A974TJ9), or submitting [an issue on Youtrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/KTOR).

If you're more interested in making major contributions to the framework, then here is the place where you can submit 
your proposals.

To submit a proposal:

1. Fork this repository
2. Copy the `0000-template.md` into the [proposals](proposals) directory under an appropriate filename.
3. Fill in all the relevant details for the proposal, as described in the template.
4. Create a pull request with the new proposal.
5. Wait for a review and the acceptance of your proposal.

After a proposal is accepted, it will be ready to be implemented into Ktor.
